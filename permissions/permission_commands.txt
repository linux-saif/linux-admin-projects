This project demonstrates basic Linux file and directory permissions, ownership management, and access control using standard Linux commands.
It is designed for beginners and junior Linux administrators to understand how permissions work in real-world environments.
# Prerequisites

    Linux system (Ubuntu / CentOS / RHEL / Fedora)

    Basic command-line knowledge

    Non-root user with sudo access

 Task 1: Check Default File Permissions
 Objective

Understand default permissions assigned to files and directories.
 Steps

touch file1
mkdir dir1
ls -l

 Output Explanation

    -rw-r--r-- → File permissions

    drwxr-xr-x → Directory permissions

 Learning

    Files don’t get execute permission by default

    Directories require execute (x) permission to access

 Task 2: Change File Permissions Using chmod
 Objective

Modify permissions using numeric mode.
 Steps

chmod 755 file1
ls -l file1

🔹 Permission Breakdown
Number	Meaning
7	rwx
5	r-x
5	r-x
🔹 Result

Owner can read, write, execute
Group and others can read and execute
📂 Task 3: Remove Write Permission from Group & Others
🔹 Objective

Restrict write access.
🔹 Steps

chmod go-w file1
ls -l file1

🔹 Learning

Symbolic mode (go-w) is safer and easier to modify specific permissions.
📂 Task 4: Change Ownership of a File
🔹 Objective

Assign file ownership to another user.
🔹 Steps

sudo chown testuser file1
ls -l file1

🔹 Learning

Only root can change ownership.
📂 Task 5: Change Group Ownership
🔹 Objective

Change file group ownership.
🔹 Steps

sudo chgrp developers file1
ls -l file1

📂 Task 6: Directory Permissions Test
🔹 Objective

Understand directory access behavior.
🔹 Steps

mkdir secure_dir
chmod 700 secure_dir
ls -ld secure_dir

🔹 Result

Only the owner can access the directory.
📂 Task 7: Prevent File Deletion Using Permissions
🔹 Objective

Stop users from deleting files.
🔹 Steps

mkdir shared
chmod 777 shared
touch shared/data.txt
chmod 644 shared/data.txt

🔹 Explanation

    File deletion depends on directory permissions, not file permissions

📂 Task 8: Check umask Value
🔹 Objective

Understand default permission masking.
🔹 Steps

umask

🔹 Learning

    Default umask 022

    Files: 666 - 022 = 644

    Directories: 777 - 022 = 755
