# LVM Troubleshooting Case Study – Disk Space Issue

##  Overview
This repository contains a **real-world Linux LVM troubleshooting scenario** where a mounted filesystem ran out of space even though additional disks were available on the server.

The task demonstrates **professional troubleshooting methodology**, root cause analysis, and resolution using **Logical Volume Manager (LVM)** without downtime.

---

##  Environment Details
- Operating System: Linux (RHEL / CentOS / Ubuntu)
- Storage Type: LVM (Logical Volume Manager)
- Filesystem: ext4
- Mount Point: `/backup`
- Volume Group: `vg_data`
- Logical Volume: `lv_backup`

---

##  Problem Statement
The `/backup` filesystem reported **100% disk usage**, causing applications to fail with disk space errors.

### Error Observed
```text
No space left on device

# disk usage check
df -f

# Output
/dev/mapper/vg_data-lv_backup  1.0G  1.0G  0  100%  /backup

1: Check Available Disks
   lsblk

An additional disk (/dev/sdc) was available but not configured in LVM

2: Verify LVM Components
